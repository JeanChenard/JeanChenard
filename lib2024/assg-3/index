			<!-- Form needs two attributes to be valid: action and method. -->
			<!-- action: the page where the data goes when you submit it. -->
			<!-- method: how the data reaches its destination. -->
			<!-- two types of methods are get(default) and post.
			get (default) gets information via querry strings and appends it to the end of the adress. An example of that would be all the /something or other/ after the.com or .html on a website.
			post sends the data in encrypted packages (like when an email on the web is title sharkcheese101 when its actually about puppets). -->

					<!-- An imput element must be accompanied by a label.
					The label for is used to connect with the input element it is labeling.
					Value of the label for is the same as the value of name attribute for the input element. -->
					<!-- Note: For HTML5 the value of for as to be equal to the id's value. -->
					<label for="FirstName">First Name</label>
					<!-- Form input element must have two forms: type and name.
						type: determines the input type (for ex.: text, email, password, number, etc.
						name: serves as an unique identifier for specific input when data is submitted to the server mentioned in the action attribute of the form. -->
						<!-- Sidenote: Best practice recommends that you use the same value for id as you would for thr name  (this makes it easier to recognize when styling and/or using JavaScript). -->

The text in placeholder stays there until you type something (where it disappears) but will come back once you reload the page or remove what you write. -->
